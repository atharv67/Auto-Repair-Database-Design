# Auto-Repair-Database-Design
## This project was part of CSC-540 course at NCSU.
- In this project, we design a database system for an Auto-Repair company based on a given problem statement with multiple constraints.
- Most constraints were captured through database design rather than in application development.
- We used Oracle DB as our backend database.
- The application is built as a CLI in Java.
## File Description
- The code is present in the 'Code' folder and has all the required classes.
- The Database design is in the "ER Diagram.pdf" file.
- By running 'set_up.sql', all the required tables and triggers are created.
- By running 'populating.sql' the tables are populated with dummy data.
- The 'Discussion.pdf' documents the various tables, which level of normalization they are in and the various constraints captured.
